## Project
Restaurant website used for customers to be able to navigate the restaurantâ€™s menu and food options, then be able to order those foods online and have them delivered to their homes. Inspiration for this project was taken from Gruhub and other food delivery services but created on a smaller scale.

**1. Customer can Signup to the website, providing information such as their first name, last name, addresses, zip codes, and email.**

**2. Login and be able to add their foods, with specific quantity, and specific instructions, to their cart.**

**3. When checking out, the customer can pay with either cash or credit for their food, while prices being displayed.**

**4. A confirmation email will be sent to the customer, as well as to the admin (restaurant owner) in order to proceed with making the food and delivering it to the customer.**
